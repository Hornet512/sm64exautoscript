# sm64exautoscript
This is my first autoscript for building SM64EX on Ubuntu/Debian! It will compile it with Discord RPC, 64 bits, the external options menu, texture fixes, no drawing distance, and better camera!

You will need to provide your own byteswapped ROM in the same directory as the script called "rom.z64".

To run the script, you need to open terminal, cd to the folder the script is in, and run "chmod +x ./build.sh" (without the double-quotes).

The original repository is at https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex
